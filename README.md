### Dependency

Required Java 11 or above, Python 3.10 and above, google chrome driver.

Check the python script to know about all the python modules that's required! I actually didn't bother to keep track of all, was just going with the flow.

The routes_raw folder contains the geojson file of all the routes that's listed in MTC's website as route list. (So, yeah, MTC website is the reference to route names)

The raw route list is available in route_numbers.txt file (from MTC website)
